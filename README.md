In this project, I have been tasked to create a program that automates searching for a word definition in a dictionary with the following requirements: 
1).  We should have a data source given in the file data.json.
2). Load data into dictionary. 
3). Create the function that returns the definition of word.
4). Consider a condition that the entered word is not in a dictionary.
5). Consider input from user having different cases â€“ upper/ lower case or mixed eg: RAIN/rain/RaIN.
6).     Make your dictionary program more intelligent in case users input a word with wrong spelling the program should be able to suggest the word that might be intended.
      eg . pott instead of pot or rainn instead of rain
